# Constants

Constants in Crabby are immutable, meaning that once a constant is assigned a value, it cannot be changed. This is a fundamental aspect of the language that helps prevent accidental modification of data.

To declare a constant, you use the `const` keyword followed by the name of the constant and its value. For example:

```js
const PI: Float = 3.14159
const MAX_USERS: Int = 100
```

In this example, we have declared two constants: `PI` and `MAX_USERS`. `PI` is assigned the value `3.14159`, and `MAX_USERS` is assigned the value `100`.

Constants can be used in expressions and calculations, just like variables. For example:

```js
const radius: Float = 10
const area: Float = PI * radius * radius
```

In this example, we calculate the area of a circle with a given radius.
