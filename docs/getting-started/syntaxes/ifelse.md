# If Else

In Crabby, using `if` & `else` statements are a way to make decisions in your code. It's a simple and straightforward way to control the flow of your program based on certain conditions.

Here's an example of an `if` statement in Crabby:

```js
let x = true
let y = false

if x { // If choose 'y', then it'll return it false
    print("True!")
} else {
    print("False!")
}
```

In this example, we have two variables `x` and `y`. We use the `if` statement to check if `x` is true or false. If `x` is true, then the program will print "True!".
