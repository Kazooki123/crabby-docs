# Introduction

**Welcome to the world of Crabby**, a revolutionary programming language made entirely in the **Zig language**, designed to meet the demands of the modern programming era. Crabby is not just another language; it's a paradigm shift that aims to redefine the way we approach programming.

Note: Crabby **isn't a fully functional** programming language yet. So that's why we need you to help us create crabby.

## Features

- Crabby designed for simplicity.
- Easy to learn and understand.
- Ideal for beginners.
- Powerful for handling complex tasks.
- Suitable for experienced developers too.

## Example

This is an example of a **hello world** program

```python
hello.cb ("cb" short for crabby)
```

### hello.cb

```python
import 'output' from 'std';

output.print("Hello World");
```

### Let's break down

**import 'output' from 'std';** - Means that it is importing the "output" from Crabby's standard library(std)

**output.print** - The syntax to print "Hello World"(without it, it throws an error)

**";"** - This is very optional. Without this again it throws an error.

We will also make a code runner on this docs website!
