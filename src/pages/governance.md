# Governance

Crabby is an **open-source** project, but it is **not a consensus-driven project**.

This page explains how decisions are made and how the project is guided.

## Project Status

Crabby is currently:

- Unstable
- Experimental
- Actively evolving
- Maintained primarily by a single dev

Many **features** are incomplete or plannned rather than implemented.

## Leadership Model

Crabby follows a **Founder-led** governance model.

- The original author acts as the primary decision-maker
- Design direction, syntax choices, and especially **philosophy** are guided by the project vision.
- Feedback and discussion are welcome, but not all suggestions will be accepted.

This helps keep the language focused and consistent.

## Decision Making

Decisions are made based on:

- Long-term clarity and simplicity
- Educational and exploratory value
- Maintainability for a small team
- Alignment with Crabby's philosophy

Popularity, trends, or external pressure are **NOT** primary decision drivers.

## Community Expectations

Crabby values:

- Respectful Communication
- Curiosity over Elistism
- Simplicity over Cleverness
- Learning over Performance Competition

Harassment, gatekeeping, or dismissive behavior are **NOT** acceptable.

## Scope & Promises

Crabby does not guarantee:

- Backward Compatibility
- Stability
- Feature Completeness
- Production Readiness

The project **evolves** at a sustainable pace.

## License & Direction

Under the **GPLv3** licnese, this license choice is intentional and reflects the project's commitment to user freedom and openess!

## Final Note

**Crabby is a long-term project.**

**Growth may be slow, and that is acceptable.**

The goal is to not just win - **Its to build something meaningful, honestly, and sustainably.**

Thank you.
- The Crabby Team.
